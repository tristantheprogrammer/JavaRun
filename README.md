Project Name: Java Run

Team Name: The Mobile Gamer

Team Member: Tristan Toma

I am attempting to build an endless runner game that can be played on mobile devices. This game will be similar to one of the most famous endless runner games of all time, Temple Run. I want to build this game because I plan on becoming a Video Game Developer when I grow up. It will be useful to keep people entertained throughout their day. Some people have very stressful days and maybe my game could keep them not stressed. It will be used on mobile devices by people of all ages.

Plan and Estimate of Effort:

I will first go in to Visual Studio and create the base for all of my classes that I listed in my UML class diagram. I will then do some research on JavaFX and see how I can use it to implement my game ideas from my Java code into actual interfaces. I will use JavaFX to create animations, graphics, and many more features for my game. I expect this project to take me about three weeks as it will prove to be quite challenging to code. Once all of my code is done, I will go through a rigorous testing and debugging process as my game might have some unexpected bugs in it. Once the testing and debugging process is done, I will hopefully upload my game so that everyone can enjoy it!

User Manual:

The controls of my Java Run program are very simple.

You use spacebar to make the blue square jump. The objective of the game is to jump over the red squares and increase your score as much as possible without getting a game over. If you run into a red square, a game over screen will be displayed. The game over screen will also display your final score.

Implementation Manual:

I used many classes in my project that I didn't add into my UML Class Diagram. I also didn't add some classes that were listed in my UML Class Diagram. I only used one class in my project which is JavaRun. I used a lot of methods to make my program function correctly. The methods that I used are all listed in my JavaRun.java file. To sum up my methods, I created a "start" method to create all of the necessary shapes and textboxes that my project is using. I created a jump method to allow my square to jump vertically. I created an update method to add gravity and to check whether the user has landed their square. I created a "moveObstacles" method to set their X axis placement and to get rid of obstacles that are out of the scene. I created a "createObstacle" method to create the shape for the obstacles. I created a "checkCollisions" method to check whether or not the user ran into an obstacle. Lastly, I created a "showGameOverScreen" method to create a game over screen scene.
