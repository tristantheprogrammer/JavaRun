Project Name: Java Run
Team Name: The Mobile Gamer
Team Member: Tristan Toma

I am attempting to build an endless runner game that can be played on mobile devices. This game will be similar to one of the most famous endless runner games of all time, Temple Run. I want to build this game because I plan on becoming a Video Game Developer when I grow up. It will be useful to keep people entertained throughout their day. Some people have very stressful days and maybe my game could keep them not stressed. It will be used on mobile devices by people of all ages.

Plan and Estimate of Effort:

I will first go in to Visual Studio and create the base for all of my classes that I listed in my UML class diagram. I will then do some research on JavaFX and see how I can use it to implement my game ideas from my Java code into actual interfaces. I will use JavaFX to create animations, graphics, and many more features for my game. I expect this project to take me about three weeks as it will prove to be quite challenging to code. Once all of my code is done, I will go through a rigorous testing and debugging process as my game might have some unexpected bugs in it. Once the testing and debugging process is done, I will hopefully upload my game so that everyone can enjoy it!
